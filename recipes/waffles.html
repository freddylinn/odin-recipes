        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>To this day, nothing has topped this simple waffle recipe as the ultimate breakfast. This recipe will
            deal with proper toppings and techniques more than cooking the waffles themselves.
        </p>
        <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A Working Waffle Iron</li>
            <li>Waffle Batter</li>
            <li><strong>Nutella</strong></li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Whipped Cream</li>
            <li>100% Pure Maple Syrup</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour your waffle batter into the waffle iron at a medium-low setting so they're fluffy instead of crunchy and sad</li>
            <li>After the waffle is cooked, immediately plate it and spread nutella evenly across half the waffle and butter across the other half
                to get the best of both worlds
            </li>
            <li>Pour the maple syrup on top of the waffle in a zig zag or spiral pattern. No exceptions</li>
            <li>Top the waffle with whipped cream in a pretty spiral</li>
            <li>Ruin your pretty spiral by spreading the whipped cream evenly across the whole waffle to get some in every bite</li>
        </ol>
