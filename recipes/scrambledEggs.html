        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the simple recipe I use for making scrambled eggs.
            It may not be the most <em>professional</em> but it works well.
            My source being that I'm still alive and (usually) enjoy the eggs
            I make.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Eggs</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Shredded Cheese (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt a small chunk of butter in a medium-sized pan
                on medium-low temperature. Make sure to spread the butter all around the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Crack 3 eggs into a bowl and add a splash of milk and dashes of salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Mix everything in the bowl together with a fork</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the pan</li>
            <li>Push the edges of the eggs inward toward the center of the pan for a couple
                minutes until you have an egg "pancake"
            </li>
            <li>Flip the egg pancake over to cook the other side. Cook until both sides have the
                slightest bit of brown
            </li>
            <li>Top with shredded cheese while the eggs are still hot and move them to a plate</li>
            <li>Chop and scramble the eggs around with your fork so you don't feel like you're eating
                an egg pancake
            </li>
        </ol>
