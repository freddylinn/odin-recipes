        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe will help you get stronger without having to choke down something like a kale smoothie. The recipe's pretty versatile so you could always
            switch out the selected fruits for other ones like mangos.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Frozen Blueberries</li>
            <li>Frozen Raspberries</li>
            <li>Frozen Strawberries</li>
            <li>Low-Sugar High-Protein Yogurt</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Vanilla Protein Powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dump as much of each ingredient as you want into a blender. I recommend using only a little bit of milk for more thickness</li>
            <li>Blend and when you almost inevitably fail, crush the frozen fruits with a fork like your life depends on it</li>
            <li>Repeat Step 2 until there are no large chunks left and everything is smooth</li>
        </ol>
